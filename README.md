#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a computer science discipline that deals with requirement analysis, designing, devolopment, deploymemt, 
testing and maintenance of software projects.
importance of software engineering in the technology industry
It helps to delvelop scalable softwares which handle user load even if it increases.
It helps to handle big projects which requires planning so as to build the model right.
Through maintenance and testing reliable softwares can be built.
Through software engineering more security resilience software can be built. This is done
through authentication and authorization.
Through software engeneering software undergoes software testing to enhance software assurance.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Developpment of compiler In 1948 Grace Hopper developed the first compiler. A compiler translates
human readable code into machine code.
FORTRAN In 1957 a high programming language was released.
Releasing CASE tools. The first computer aided tools were released.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Preliminary study This is a brief investigation of the system under consideration and gives a clear
picture of what actually the physical system is.
Feasibility study It is a preliminary study to determine if an organization should be computerized or 
an information system should be developed to replace the current one.
System analysis It si a process of collecting factual data, understand the processes involved identifying problems
and recommending feasible suggestions for improving the system  functioning.
System design The logical system design arrived at a result of system analysis is converted into physical system design.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In water fall model  is sequencial and each phase must be completed in order to proceed to the next phase. while in agile it 
is  iterative and allows flexibility and adjustments.
waterfall model is heavily documented at each stage and this makes it  difficult to change after completion of any  phase. 
While in agile changes can be easily rendered.
In waterfall risk are identified and are addressed in early stages and issues discovered later can be very tedious. 
while Risks are addressed continuous, feedback is received and adjustments made accordingly.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
#Software Developer
Requirement analysis A software developer has the responsibilty to gather requirements from users so that he can translate
them into technical specifications.
A software developer designs the prototype and solutions to the problem gathered.
A software developer writes the code, test, and maintain it in order to solve the problem.
A software developer has the responsibility toperform tests to the software followed by debugging to enhance quality assuarance.

#a Quality Assurance Engineer
Quality Assurance Engineer provides training to other team members on quality assuarance practices.
Quality Assurance Engineer develops automated testst scripts to enhance efficiency.
Quality Assurance Engineer works together with proct nmanagers and users to requirements and provide feedback.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures that the software products developed with company standards, policies and regulations.

#Project Manager
A Project Manager determines the budget required in the software development.
A Project Manager ensures proper allocation of resoucers such as the skilled personnel to make sure that project goals are met.
A Project Manager ensures that there is a proper coordination among project team to enhance efficiency.
A Project Manager works closely to monitor that the software being developed meets the specification and ultimate quality assurance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs have tools for running tests and streamlining the process of compiling code.
IDEs has drag and drop design tools that simplify the creation of user interfaces.
IDEs help to manage files and dependencies, making it easier to navigate and organize large codebases.
IDEs has debugging tools to fix issues. 
Examples osf IDEs are Pycharm, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.

VCS enables developers to track changes made.
VCS enables multiple developers to work together.
VCS enables developers to work on separete features before merging them into the main code base. 
Examples of VCS Git, SUbversion, Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
