Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a computer science discipline that deals with requirement analysis, designing, devolopment, deploymemt, 
testing and maintenance of software projects.
importance of software engineering in the technology industry
It helps to delvelop scalable softwares which handle user load even if it increases.
It helps to handle big projects which requires planning so as to build the model right.
Through maintenance and testing reliable softwares can be built.
Through software engineering more security resilience software can be built. This is done
through authentication and authorization.
Through software engeneering software undergoes software testing to enhance software assurance.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Developpment of compiler In 1948 Grace Hopper developed the first compiler. A compiler translates
human readable code into machine code.
FORTRAN In 1957 a high programming language was released.
Releasing CASE tools. The first computer aided tools were released.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Preliminary study This is a brief investigation of the system under consideration and gives a clear
picture of what actually the physical system is.
Feasibility study It is a preliminary study to determine if an organization should be computerized or 
an information system should be developed to replace the current one.
System analysis It si a process of collecting factual data, understand the processes involved identifying problems
and recommending feasible suggestions for improving the system  functioning.
System design The logical system design arrived at a result of system analysis is converted into physical system design.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In water fall model  is sequencial and each phase must be completed in order to proceed to the next phase. while in agile it 
is  iterative and allows flexibility and adjustments.
waterfall model is heavily documented at each stage and this makes it  difficult to change after completion of any  phase. 
While in agile changes can be easily rendered.
In waterfall risk are identified and are addressed in early stages and issues discovered later can be very tedious. 
while Risks are addressed continuous, feedback is received and adjustments made accordingly.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
