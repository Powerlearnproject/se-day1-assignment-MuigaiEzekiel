Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a computer science discipline that deals with requirement analysis, designing, devolopment, deploymemt, 
testing and maintenance of software projects.
importance of software engineering in the technology industry
It helps to delvelop scalable softwares which handle user load even if it increases.
It helps to handle big projects which requires planning so as to build the model right.
Through maintenance and testing reliable softwares can be built.
Through software engineering more security resilience software can be built. This is done
through authentication and authorization.
Through software engeneering software undergoes software testing to enhance software assurance.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Developpment of compiler In 1948 Grace Hopper developed the first compiler. A compiler translates
human readable code into machine code.
FORTRAN In 1957 a high programming language was released.
Releasing CASE tools. The first computer aided tools 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
